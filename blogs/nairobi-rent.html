  <h1>Nairobi Rental Price Prediction</h1>

  </p>

  <p class="article-intro">
    Rental prices in Nairobi vary widely depending on location, property size,
    and available amenities. This project applies machine learning techniques
    to predict monthly rental prices based on structured property data.
  </p>

  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of this project was to build a predictive model that estimates
    monthly rent for residential properties in Nairobi using key features such
    as location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, parking availability, estimated
    size, and distance to the Central Business District (CBD).
  </p>

  <h2>Dataset & Features</h2>
  <p>
    The dataset consisted of structured housing records collected from rental
    listings. Key features used in the model included:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Number of bedrooms and bathrooms</li>
    <li>Parking availability</li>
    <li>Estimated property size</li>
    <li>Location / neighborhood</li>
    <li>Distance to Nairobi CBD</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    The workflow followed a standard machine learning pipeline:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Data cleaning and preprocessing</li>
    <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</li>
    <li>Feature encoding and scaling</li>
    <li>Training regression models</li>
    <li>Model evaluation and comparison</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Multiple regression algorithms were tested, and performance was evaluated
    using error metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared
    Error (RMSE).
  </p>

  <h2>Key Insights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Location had the strongest influence on rental prices</li>
    <li>Properties closer to the CBD were significantly more expensive</li>
    <li>Size and number of bedrooms showed strong positive correlation with rent</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates how machine learning can support data‑driven
    decision‑making in real estate. The final model provides reasonable rental
    price estimates and can be extended with additional data such as property
    age or market trends.
